what is react fragment ?
	it's tag-less container used to group multiple nodes/elements without adding extra element to the DOM.
	syntax is <React.Fragment></React.Fragment> or <></>; we use the former if we want to add attribute other than key.

what is virtual dom ?
	it's representation of actual/real dom. It's a DOM in memory, React uses virtual dom to undergo a diff reconcillation.
	
what is reconcillation in React ?
	reconcillation is a diffing algorithm used to decide how component is re-rendered in React. Note, DOM manipulation is
	expensive and time consuming.

what is React Fiber ?
	it's a newer reconcillation algorithm engine used by React. It's much faster and smarter than stack reconcillation algorithm
	which was used before React-16. Stack is synchronous while Fiber is asynchronous which compares current-dom with work-in-progress.

why we need keys in React ?
	React uses virtual DOM to spot any differences between the DOM trees. If we are rendering same type of mulitple tags(
	like (muliple div's or h1's), react will need to uniquely identify inorder to know which items have changed, added, or removed 
	from the virtual dom to avoid re-rendering. Note, if we are rendering mulitple different types of tags, it's not required to use key.

what is props in React ?
	props is like attributes we pass to react component. It's like function parameter used to make our component dynamic.

what is config driven UI ?
	it's UI architecture that uses configurarion file/data to display different UI when building the App layout.
