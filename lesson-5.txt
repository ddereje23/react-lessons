what is the diff between named export, default export and * as export ?
	it's ES6 way of exporting modules. we have to use {}/named-import for named export. we can import default exports using any name.
	we can also import all named exports like this: import * as obj from 'file-name', then we can access them using obj.module-name.
	
what is importance of config.js file ?
	it's file used to maintain some configuration/constants in config driven UI.

what is React Hooks ?
	these are functions which helps us work with react in much cleaner way.
	
why we need useState Hook ?
	useState hook helps maintain the state of the component. Thus when this state updates react will use its reconcillation
	algorithm to re-render that component. Note changing local variable doesn't cause react to re-render. Only chage in State variables do.
